Final Year Project - "Developing Healthy Habits to Improve Wellbeing using Machine Learning"

## Abstract
Incorporating healthy habits into a person’s lifestyle can be an incredibly difficult task. Behavioural research has identified the ‘habit loop’ as a core element of habit formation. and serves as the theoretical foundation of this project. Recommendation systems have been deployed successfully in many domains such as e-commerce and education creating a more tailored and enjoyable experience for the user. Applying the habit loop concept, this project aims to help the development of healthy habits by identifying personalised healthy routines through a machine learning-based recommendation system. To meet this aim, a machine learning system is developed to provide personalised activity recommendations via the consideration of users’ activity interests, activities viewed/completed and personal user data. This system also incorporates elements of the habit loop to encourage healthy habit formation. While many recommendation algorithms exist, their challenges and characteristics, along with the properties of the software system in its context of use is considered, when making design and implementation choices. This project explores recommendation algorithms that are relevant to the proposed software system solution and its implementation. In addition, academic literature in the formation of habits is used to guide the development of the system. A good degree of focus is placed on the software design and development techniques utilised in the construction of the project software system in order to provide an adequate level of software quality, particularly maintainability for future work. Performance of this algorithm is measured using suitable evaluation metrics. A user evaluation of the software system is also conducted, where a small focus group is introduced to the software system and surveyed to provide feedback on its effectiveness to contribute to establishing healthy habits. Based on the testing and evaluation, conclusions are drawn in relation to whether the aim of the project was fulfilled, along with limitations and areas of future work are identified.

## Conclusion
In this dissertation, a solution has been provided to the challenging problem of establishing healthy habits through the successful implementation of a machine learning software system with features following the principles of the habit loop. This is an important step to find practical solutions to aid in easier healthier habits establishment, as well as applying the correct recommendation algorithm relevant to the context of the problem solution while working around the challenges of the recommendation systems.
The concerns of maintainability were addressed through utilisation of a MVC design pattern and abiding by the principles of object-oriented programming. Exhaustive test cases were generated to achieve a software system that is closer to being error-free. In addition, the software system is evaluated in relevance to its purpose. The resulting metrics performed on the recommendation engine summarise to be reliable. As well as the successful implementation of the principles of the habit loop integrated into the software system.

## Objectives & Were They Met
| Objective | How this Objective is met |
| --- | ---|
|Background Research <br> - Research supervised/unsupervised learning, collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, Neural Networks and Hybrids.<br> - Based on the research, decide on the recommendation algorithm most suitable for the project.| Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering systems were researched and analysed to conclude the optimum filtering technique for the project. After research and analysis content-based filtering system was the most suitable filtering technique for the project.|
 
Requirements & Approach
• Based on the research stipulate requirements fit for the project.
• Consider the best approach of software development methodology for the proposed solution.
Requirements were formed taking in the consideration of challenges in recommendation systems, recommendation system algorithms, Habits in academic literature and existing systems. After careful analysis of waterfall and agile approaches. Elements of the agile approach was incorporated into the project development.
Design
• Design prototype/mock-ups, user flow diagram, entity relationship model to guide the implementation process.
Low fidelity and high-fidelity designs were utilised to design the user interface of the application. In addition, use case diagrams and descriptions were used to clarify the possible actions of the actors of the system. A layered architecture pattern presented the main components of the software system. Finally, class diagrams were used to design and represent the structural class architecture of the software system.
Implementation
• Implement software utilizing the design. Confirm the software meets the requirements specifications and provides a valid solution to the project aim.
Implementation stage of this project shows that all the designs generated were utilised in the implementation process. In addition, all the requirements’ specifications mentioned in 4.2: Requirements were met.
Testing and Evaluation
• Perform unit, integration, system testing on each sprint/iteration of the software. Finally, software evaluation needs to be incorporated following the BREO process. Capture users’ feedback on the final software system using BREO approved questionnaire sheets.
Exhaustive unit, integration and system testing were performed which can be seen in the test cases provided in Chapter 6: Testing. Individual units of the software systems were tested. Tests were also performed on the integrated units of the software system. Finally, the entire software system was tested and showed no signs of bugs or errors. Evaluation of the software system followed the BREO approved process. The resulting user’s feedback were used to identify problems with the system, what the users found useful and work on future iterations of the project.
Conclusion
• Conclude if the project aims were met by considering the results of the evaluation and testing.
From the results gathered from the evaluation and testing of the software system, it can be concluded, the project meets its aims set in the beginning of this project.

Limitations
• The project encountered a cold-start problem as the original intended filtering technique to use for this project was collaborative filtering, which is a better recommendation algorithm overall as discussed in 2.4: Algorithms.
• Activities data were missing step-by-step instructions which were pointed out during evaluation of the software system.
• Lack of number of activities available for the recommendation engine to perform optimally.
• Limitations to the evaluation methods due to government restrictions set for pandemic.
Future Work
• Adopt a collaborative filtering algorithm if the number of users extend to a thousand in order to offer diversification of recommendations.
• Add real activities data with step-by-step instructions for each activity. In addition, add more activities data greater than fifty in order for the recommendation engine to perform better.
• Conduct in person evaluations by getting participants to use the application in person after government restrictions are lifted.
• Incorporate a colour palette for the user interface as the current user interface can be considered bland and boring.
• Feature’s participants found useful in other application or would like to see in the project application which could possibly be implemented to aid the project goal:
o Feature to display user activity to the user as a possible measure for accomplishment.
o Leader board to compare with friends.
o Expansion on why certain activities is recommended and their benefits.
o Integration with fitness devices (i.e., smart watch) to count calories burned.
Reflecting on the development of the software system and the end system. Future work is definitively evident in order to push the software system to the public market. From incorporating real activities dataset to the vast array of possible features to implement, acquired through participant evaluation presented in the list above. As it is apparent, these practical improvement suggestions aid in taking the next steps necessary to ameliorate present work.
